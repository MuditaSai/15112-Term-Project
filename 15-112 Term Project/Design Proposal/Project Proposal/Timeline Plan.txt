Pathfinding algorithm + Maze generation: Apr 17

User movement on the maze + Monster movement (done via Dijkstra’s): Apr 19

Features: Switcheroo, special items, player + monster class: Apr 21

Post MVP: Extension of Djikstra’s algo to A* to make monster catch up to the player faster, additional monsters spawned at different locations (player can change locations with any one of the monsters), better GUI: Apr 27
